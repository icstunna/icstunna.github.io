                <p>In 2004 David Heinemeier Hansson developed Ruby on Rails or Rails, while working on "Basecamp" a project management tool by 37signals. He released Rails to be open sourced in 2005,and in 2006, Apple announced that it would ship Rails as part of its Leopard operating system. Rails is an open source web application framework that is written in the programming language Ruby. Rails uses best practice software paradigms such as Model View Controller (MVC), Active Record Pattern (ARP) and Convention over Configuration (COC).</p>

            <p>PA MVC is a software architecture that implements user interfaces. The MVC allows the user to use an application in 3 componenets. The user uses a controller in order to make changes to the model / program. Once the input from the user is receive through the controller, the controller then manipulates the model / program with the parameters set by the user. The model / program then takes the information from the controller and updates its state meaning that when there have been changes made it complies to those changes and forwards those changes to the view. The view requests information from the model / program in order to display an output for the user. This whole cycle then loops back to the user.</p>

            <h3><a href="#">Conflict</a></h3>
            <h6>Written by <a href="http://icstunna.github.io/blog/c8-conflict.html">Mikhail Delos Trinos</a> on February 13, 2015</h6>

                <p>Conflict at the workplace seems to always be a never ending cycle. The difficulty of working with others is that at some point you will find an occassion to disagree or to misunderstand one anothers intentions. In my previous jobs, I often came into conflict with those who I felt, directed their anger towards others. I have very few pet peeves but one that always bothers me is when one is unable to control their temper and they either throws tantrums or direct their anger towards others. These usually occur because a deal didn't fall through, there were delays in creating a report or general impatience.</p>

            <p>The emotions I feel around these people are withdrawal, anxiety and over-all dis-comfort. It generally makes the environment a uncomfortable and toxic environment to work in. The way I would usually try to resolve these issues with people would be, to talk out their frustrations. This usually gave me a better understanding of why they are upset and why they might be projecting.</p>
