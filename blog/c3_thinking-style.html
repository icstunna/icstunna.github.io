      Unit 1 of Phase 0 is coming to an end. Over the past 3 weeks we've learned how to use Git and Github for version control. We learned the basics of HTML and CSS and have finally started learning Ruby. It has been a challenge to say the least and also one of the most enjoyable and interesting fields I've ever studied. It's interesting because it's almost exactly as I pictured it. Solving coding problems has been more a creative process then a rigid formula to follow. It's creativity expressed through logic with only the bounds of syntax to hold you.
    </p>
    <p>
      That having been said, it's still extremely challenging. I've been frustrated by problems for hours where I had 30 lines of code and found that the answer can be solved in as little as 6 or 7. I've had eureka moments when things finally do work. I've also had the grind of solving individual issues until the project worked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've learned a lot about myself through these challenges. For one thing I'm a experimenter, a tinkerer. According to the Gregorc thinking style I'm a "Concrete Random Thinker." This means I like to experiment to find answers, I take risks, I rely on intuition and I'm best when I solve problems independently. This means I must use trial-and-error methods in order to come up with a solution. I must also spend a lot of time reflecting on problems in order to fully grasp my solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      My learning style does have its challenges. I'm not the best when I'm under restriction or limitations. I'm not very good with routies and I'm not great at expressing how I came to my solution, mostly because I tinker with things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going forward I'll have to play to my strengths by spending time by myself with a problem before reaching out for help. And though I'm not good with restrictions, I'll need to learn to maximize my time so that I don't go overboard by spending too much time on a problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall I'm glad to know what works best for me. From a growth mindset perspective, I look at this more as a chance to play to my strengths and look to others to help cover my weaknesses and perhaps improve on them. I'm glad unit 1 is done and I now look forward to the heavy coding going forward.
