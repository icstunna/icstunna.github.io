      Part of the philosophy of Dev Bootcamp is to pair with another person in order to solve programming challenges. This is counter intuitive to the prototypical view that programmers are isolated and contained within their work and cubicle. Pair programming has become ever increasingly popular in tech world, it increases efficiency and decreases errors. This is why we students are now coming to be in the habit of pair programming.
    </p>
    <p>
      My experience pairing while solving programming problems have been for the most part extremely beneficial. Having a partner with you while you solve difficult problems brings in different perspectives and tactics to solve a problem. One of the best experiences I had pairing was my partner and I going through code to try to understand why something worked the way we did and expressing our understanding of the logic. In doing so we were able to refactor the code to make it less cumbersome and more aesthetically appealing and understandable.
    </p>

      While the benefits certainly out weigh the potential problems, pair programming does come with it the issues that arise when people interact. One of the most difficult pairing sessions I had was when my partner and I were going through a guided pairing session with an instructor and didn't have enough time to complete the problem. We spent a lot of time discussing what code did with one another that we weren't able to go through all the problems with the instructor within the alloted time. We recieved reviews that said that we weren't able to demonstrate compentencies in certain aspects.The difficulty was that my partner and I required time to review and understand the code before we could manipulate it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the feedback certainly hurt it was also constructive. We needed to be more mindful of the amount of time we spend on each problem and be aware of when we're spinning in circles our being inconclusive. I'm also going to personally more aware of when I'm leading a discussion to be off topic or not constructive to solving the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      While reflecting upon feedback is difficult, equally challenging is giving fair and constructive feedback to you partner. If a partner upsets you, you need to be able to detach yourself from the negative criticism or emotions you feel and give them feedback that would help them see their blind spots. I try to make sure that when I give feedback that I tell them what they can do to improve upon their weaknesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's necessary that we remain empathetic towards one another but to still be willing to say what must be said to improve. This is a fine balance and I tend to lean more towards the side of a soft touch but none the less no one can improve without the truth and no one will listen if you're not kind.
