      Asking the good questions or the right question is the examination of the problem you're facing. There's plenty of ways to ask an ineffective or wrong question. To list some of the most common mistakes are inspecificity, lack of background, irreproducible problems or over-all inability to articulate.
    </p>
    <p>
       Normally questions cannot be solved because the person trying to help doesn't understand what it is that is being asked. These mistakes prevent those who wish to help you from understanding your problem and therefor they are unable to provide the best solution. The best way to prevent this is to go through a period of introspection with your problem then try to provide a specific question, give the background and nature of your problem and research the problem to provide references to similar problems and solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Asking a specific questions is the first step to finding the best solution. By specific, I mean that one should be able to state why they are having difficulty with a problem. You should have an idea of the origin of the problem and know the proper terminology in order to specify why it is you are having difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one with difficulty should then provide a background to their problem. The question should include a background of why one is trying to solve this problem in order to provide context of what it is one is looking for. The person providing a solution can then provide alternatives to the problem, keeping a specific goal in mind as opposed to strictly following a specific problem set.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, it would be helpful if the person asking a question were able to provide some sort of re-createable scenarios similar to the question being asked. By doing so you can give examples of similar problems and solutions that may be emulated to solve your problem or at the very least provide ideas to those assisting towards the path you think would be best to follow.
