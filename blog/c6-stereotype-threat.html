      I often become self-conscience about how people perceive me. I wonder how my actions or lack of action is being taken by those around me. This week we're reflecting on "Stereotype Threats." These are thoughts that are comprised of one being self-conscience of the affirmation of stereotypes through ones actions. While I'm aware if I may be displaying certain stereotypes, I think what I'm more more conscience of is if I'm not living up to certain stereotypes.

      As an Asian-American growing up in a 90% caucasian neighborhood my stereotypes were not necessarily negative but certainly stereotypical. I was expected to be a model citizen and excellent in the subjects of math and science. I was self conscience of the expectation to do well academically. I felt as though I should try to live up to the stereotypes that teachers and peers had of me. This caused me to stress about how my intelligence and if I lived up to the expectations.

      I tried to keep up with this facade all the way through high school. I remember an occassion when I was trying to complete my assignment for Trig and one of my classmates asked for my help in the assignment. Despite my awareness that I felt uneasy about the subject, I didn't want to surrender to the notion that I may not be capable of helping him. We both ended up failing the assignment and allowed my pride and the expectations of others cloud by better judgement.

      In order to reconcile this I'd like to be part of an environment that is aware of the true characteristics of others. Stereotypes whether they be derogatory or to the praise of others are still the imposed expectation of characteristics unto another person. I think it would be better to see beyond the stereotypes and see true character. That someone be weak or excellent mathematically or artistically despite nationality and that acts of culture whether ethnic, racial or religious be confined to the choices of a person not the people.
