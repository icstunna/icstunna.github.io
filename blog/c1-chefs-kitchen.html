      I'm going to document a side of me that I don't normally speak about in public. I have a love for Online Games, specifically MMORPG's like Runescape, Everquest and World of Warcraft. One game stands out as the most unique amongst them, Eve Online. Without boring you of the details, it is a space based game with a Galaxy of over 7,000 star systems. Unlike other games, there is no quest system, no story and no beginner levels. You're thrown into a galaxy with 200,000 other players to create your own friends, your own missions and your own story. They call this concept a "Sand Box."

      My appreciation for this type of content allows me to appreciate the type of learning that Devbootcamp is encouraging. They seem to be an environment where they provide you the tools to do great and wonderful things but it's up to the users / students to create their content and make the most of their environment. DBC's emphasis is on creativity and our ability to do great things not through a structured environment, but through the encouragement of infinite possibilites.

      This environment is both exciting and terrifying. I belive that my engagements in this sort of culture will be that of a steep learning curve, high expectations and very little time or margin for error. I'll be given a lot of tools and freedom to be either dangerous or to steer myself into failure. This form of freedom and empowerment with a dash of fear will be excellent motivation. My expectations remain the same. I will to learn to code, I'll develop excellent skills and habits, I'll complete the tasks on time and find suitable employment however; I will be a fool if I don't recognize my own fears and insecurities. The boats have been burned, take the fortress or die on the beach.
