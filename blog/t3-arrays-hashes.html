      First we'll start with Arrays. Arrays are a list of values / objects. Each value / object in the array is like a variable.

      Example:
      array_x = [1, 2, 3]

      The array X has a list of numbers (1,2,3). An array keeps track of these objects through use of an index with a base of 0. In order to access these elements you can call on the array by calling the index value.

      Example:

      array_x[0] = 1
      array_x[2] = 2
    </p>
    <p>
      Hashes are similar to arrays in that they create lists. The major difference is that instead of using an index for their values / objects. Hashes use a key per value system. This means that they can use arbitrary objects to symbolize values in the list.

      Example:

      hash_y ={
        "age" => 26
        "hometown" => "Phoenix"
        "state" => "AZ"

      }

      In order to access hashes you must use the key that is associated with the value you are trying to retrieve.

      Example:

      hash_y["age"] = 26
      hash_y["state"] = "AZ"

      This allows you to retrieve data by associating it to another object.
    </p>
    <p>
      The difference between Hashes and Arrays are clear but the time and occassion to use them can be confusing. Hashes are best used when you wish to associate a value to a certain object like in the age and state example above.

      Arrays are best used when you wish to create an ordered list where association is not need but more simple organization and indexing.
