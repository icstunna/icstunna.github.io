      Technology these days has crept into every single aspect of our lives. Everything from appliances, automobiles and thermostats are being revamped and re-engineered for efficiency. Technology has even crept into the world of fashion and accessories. Apple is now releasing a new watch that synchronizes with the user to monitor heart rate or receive call and emails. Google has been expirmenting with Google glass. Glasses that allow users to take photos from their point of view or even map out courses. The problem with all these items is that they're not wearable. The tech has not caught up to the fashion and while as useful as they may seem they still look like a cross between a jetson's gimmick item and a the design of a fax machine. Simply put they're not beautiful items and they're the first thing people notice on your face.

      Though these complaints seem like an exercise in vanity, I would argue that the rest of society would not be able to get behind these products unless a serious redesign of these products occur. Products like smart watches are already being redesigned by Apple completely under the premise that other smart watches prior have been market failures not because of functionality but because the users found them to uninspiring and cumbersome. Apple believes that usability of these products will increase dramitically if users are just given a platform that's more aesthetically pleasing and less frustrating to use on a daily basis.

      I think that the solution should be for technology companies to recognize their forte and either partner with established fashion companies or hire away designers to partner with engineers in the creation of these products. Like automobiles these items are highly personal and while there's a market for those who care more about function over form, I don't believe that a majority of the market would be interested in paying a premium for a hidesous tech accessory so blatantly resting om their face. Like Ferruccio Lamborghini who founded his company because Ferrari's products were too utilitarian to be worth the premium others would create their own version of these products to go beyond utility and into the realm of awe inspiring.
