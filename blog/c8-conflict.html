      Conflict at the workplace seems to always be a never ending cycle. The difficulty of working with others is that at some point you will find plently of occassions to disagree or to misunderstand each others intentions. In my previous jobs, I often came into conflict with those who I felt directed their anger towards others. I have very few pet peeves but one that always bothers me is when someone is unable to control their temper and they either throws tantrums or start directing their anger towards others. These usually occur because a deal didn't fall through, there were delays in creating a report or general impatience.

      The emotions I feel around these people are withdrawal, anxiety and over-all dis-comfort. It generally makes the environment a uncomfortable and toxic environment to work in. The way I would usually try to resolve these issues with people would to talk out their frustrations. This usually gave me a better understanding about why they were upset and get a better understanding of why they might be projecting.

      While speaking to these people was helpful in understanding them and their motivations, it did not always resolve the conflict within me. Often times these would be temporary measures that may alleviate the person until they find another reason to become upset and project their frustrations. If I can go back and change anything now, it would be that I would identify early on who those people are, and distance myself from them.

      I learned that while my intentions and hopes may be that these people be able to realize their own follies, it is not my purpose to pursue the reconciliation of their character. I find that I have better peace of mind when I dettach myself from those situations and tactically choose times for discussion, reconciliation or confrontation versus treating each occassion as must fix scenario.
