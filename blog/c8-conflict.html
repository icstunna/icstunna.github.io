      Conflict at the workplace seems to always be a never ending cycle. The difficulty of working with others is that at some point you will find an occassion to disagree or to misunderstand one anothers intentions. In my previous jobs, I often came into conflict with those who I felt, directed their anger towards others. I have very few pet peeves but one that always bothers me is when one is unable to control their temper and they either throws tantrums or direct their anger towards others. These usually occur because a deal didn't fall through, there were delays in creating a report or general impatience.

      The emotions I feel around these people are withdrawal, anxiety and over-all dis-comfort. It generally makes the environment a uncomfortable and toxic environment to work in. The way I would usually try to resolve these issues with people would be, to talk out their frustrations. This usually gave me a better understanding of why they are upset and why they might be projecting.

      While speaking was helpful in understanding them and their motivations, it did not always resolve the conflict within me. Often times these would be temporary measures that may alleviate the person until they find another reason to become upset and project their frustrations. If I can go back and change anything now, it would be that I would identify early on who these people are, and distance myself from them.

      I learned that while my intentions and hopes may be that these people be able to realize their own follies; it is not my purpose to pursue the reconciliation of their character. I find that I have better peace of mind when I dettach myself from these situations and tactically choose times for discussion, reconciliation or confrontation versus treating each occassion as must fix scenario.
