      This week was my cohorts first chance to use Javascript. My first impression of Javascript was that it seemed very light, by that I mean that the syntax was less rigid then that of Ruby. Ruby had a lot of explicit declarations for things such as class and defining of methods, on top of this there was a lot of explicit order of operations when using certain built in methods such as ".each" on arrays / enumerables. Javascript on the other hand seemed to be very permissive with interchanging the use of functions. What does this mean? It means that functions seemed to be the universal form of declaring a set of actions with no real order of operations like that of ".each" or formal declarations other then the calling of function itself.

      I'm going to try to use an example in both Ruby and Javascript on this one. This week we had an assignment to create a game on Javascript based on the knowledge we've learned this week. I wanted to keep the game simple but applicable to a game in the real world. This week I chose to make a blackjack game. The first example I'll show you is how I created a blackjack game on Ruby then I'll compare that to my blackjackgame in Javascript.
