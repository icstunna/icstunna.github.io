      What are the benefits of version control?
    </p>
    <p>

      Developers go through a process of managing their files and work to keep track of the various changes they create. This allows them to expirement and deviate from the original code. Version Control is the process of managing these changes. This is done by keep tracking of various stages of the design process. An engineer can create a functional set of code then branch off into different to test functionality. If the programmer makes a mistake then they simply have to revert back to their original working code if necessary.

      How does git help you keep track of changes?
    </p>
    <p>

      Git is one of the applications developers use to execute version control. This application is used in the users local drive and is not to be confused with their online counter-part Github (though they serve similar and complementary functions). Git hub does this in multiple ways. It the medium from which you can command your terminal to clone, fetch, commit and push your code,. etc.

      Why use Github to store your code?
    </p>
    <p>
      Github is an online data base and social network that assists with version control, mutiple developer collaboration and remote access. Github is beneficial for the developer because it allows the developer to store their most to date work and still be able to look back on past work. This is similar to Git but is accessible online so it can be ran from any computer.
