      Last week my cohort and I reflected on stereotypes and stereotype threat. Now, we're asked to examine ourselves and determine our values. What is important to us? What do we think is important and what really is? Before Dev Bootcamp, I had a lucrative job in the finance industry. I was an Associate at a Private Equity firm making private investments in energy infastructure. I was financially secure and good at my job. One thing that I was not was satisfied.

      Finance is notorious for demanding that those in it devote their youth to the availability of their work at all hours. The hope is that in exchange, in you later years you have enough financially to be able to step back. What I realized is this belief is misplaced confidence. Those most successful in finance are those willing to sacrifice and devote everything in order to close a deal, make the sale or learn about more about a trade.

      I started to realize that my job was not fullfilling. While I don't expect work to be my sole means of fullfilment, I became dis-content with my position. The things that I valued in a career which are intellectual pursuit, work-life balance and societal advancement were not where I believe the finance industry was culturally centered. After researching careers in tech I found that engineers were in line with my values.
