      A relative position is a posture that repositions an element in relation to its default position. For example if an element is on the upper left hand corner of an object, and you set the position to relative then give it a position attribute; depending on the attribute the element will move in relation to its default position.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, the teal object in the screen a default position of this:
    </p>
    <img class="image" src ="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/icstunna/phase-0-unit-1/master/week-2/imgs/Relative_Before.png?token=AHtXwCah55OEJWqwiUw0qonAhJ8iRRoeks5Usin4wA%3D%3D" />
    <p>
      However when we change the settings in the CSS portion of the web-tools, then object changes its position to this (which is relative to its starting position):
    </p>
    <img class="image" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/icstunna/phase-0-unit-1/master/week-2/imgs/Relative_After.png?token=AHtXwNhrUbS3RmohQX1PZCe2QP3erdO8ks5Usi7YwA%3D%3D">
    <p>
      A absolute position is a posture that places the element at the exact spot desired. This element is not affected by other elements nor does it affect other elements. However though it doesnâ€™t change the position of other elements, it will overlap them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is an example of one element in an absolute position:
    </p>
    <img class="image" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/icstunna/phase-0-unit-1/master/week-2/imgs/Absolute_Before.png?token=AHtXwJ58FVZCtkh1RM0BAkap3Zdmgo1Pks5Usi8ewA%3D%3D">
    <p>
      Here is one example of 2 elements with an absolute position (the second overlaps the first but does not change its position):
    </p>
    <img class="image" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/icstunna/phase-0-unit-1/master/week-2/imgs/Absolute_After.png?token=AHtXwMqs2vrJJx5sfqdrWj7wGQtWpBbRks5Usi9hwA%3D%3D">
    <p>
      A fixed position is an element that stays in the same place of a page despite the page being scrolled in different directions. This is useful if you want to fixate on object to seen at all times such as a navigation bar .
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is an example of an element with a fixed position where the webpage is unmoved:
    </p>
    <img class="image" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/icstunna/phase-0-unit-1/master/week-2/imgs/Fixed_Before.png?token=AHtXwAUP0iRToHJGiGASh1j5W9py7Teoks5Usi-uwA%3D%3D">
    <p>
      Here is an example of an element with a fixed position after the page has been slightly scrolled. The element remained in its page location:
    </p>
    <img class="image" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/icstunna/phase-0-unit-1/master/week-2/imgs/Fixed_After.png?token=AHtXwD2d8nzGhMIYznEKUxB1Uty9Umaoks5Usi_awA%3D%3D">
